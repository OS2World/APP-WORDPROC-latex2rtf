History & Copyright
*******************

   In 1994 the first Version of  LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex  was written by
Fernando Dorner and Andreas Granzer of the Viena University supervised
by Ralf Schlatterbeck in a one-semester course. They created a simple
LaTeX  ifnottex  parser and added most of the infrastructure for the
program.  This was version 1.0 of  LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex .  In 1995, work
on  LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex  was continued in another one-semester course
by Friedrich Polzer and Gerhard Trisko. The result was  LaTeX2RTF
ifnottex  version 1.5.  ralf@zoo.priv.at,Ralf Schlatterbeck maintained
and extended  LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex  until 1998.

   In 1998 jorge_lehner@gmx.net,Georg Lehner found the reference to
LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex  on the
http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/index.html, TeX Conversion Webpage  of
W.Hennings@fz-juelich.de,Wilfried Hennings and added some functionality
and took over the maintainence of the program.  The last version
release by Georg is 1.8aa.  The bulk of development post 1.8aa was done
by Scott Prahl.  Wilfried Hennings now coordinates the development of
the program and maintains the project on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/,SourceForge where there are
also (low volume) mailing lists for users
latex2rtf-users@lists.sourceforge.net and developers
latex2rtf-developers@lists.sourceforge.net.  For subscription to these
lists: latex2rtf-users-request@lists.sourceforge.net?subject=subscribe
or latex2rtf-developers-request@lists.sourceforge.net?subject=subscribe

   As of April 2002, version 1.9.13 of  LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex  is
available.  One day there shall be a jump to Version 2.0, but this is
not history but future ...

Introduction
************

   LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex  is a translator program from  LaTeX  ifnottex
text into "rich text format" files.  These files are commonly referred
to as RTF files.  RTF is a published standard format by Microsoft.
This standard can be ambiguous in places and Microsoft ignores parts of
the standard it finds inconvenient, but RTF is widely used by many
WYSIWIG text editors and is supported by Microsoft Word and most text
processors.

   LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex  translates the text and as much of the
formatting information from  LaTeX  ifnottex  to RTF.  Be forewarned
that the typeset output is not nearly as good as what you would get
from using  LaTeX  ifnottex  directly.  So, why bother translating?
Consider,

  1. You use  LaTeX
         and hate everything beginning with MS- Nevertheless, you have
to share your documents with people who don't even now that there exist
other things than MS-

   You know somebody who frequently sends you very fine  LaTeX  ifnottex
documents. Unfortunately, you are "on the other side" and need to
import her files, steal some part, and then desktop publish it in your
fine MS-... environment.

   There are drawbacks to the conversion process. In fact, don't expect
any  LaTeX  ifnottex  file to be converted as you would like, don't
expect it to be converted without errors or warnings, and don't be
especially surprised when it doesn't convert at all.   LaTeX2RTF
ifnottex  is known to have many bugs and many missing features.
Paradoxically, this number seems to grow more and more with each day.
However, we can categorically state that there are some special cases,
in which a  LaTeX  ifnottex  file will be translated to RTF
satisfactorily by

   LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex  -- This was sort of disclaimer, ok? OK!

   LaTeX  ifnottex  is a system for typesetting text and therefore it
focuses on the logical structure of a document, whilst RTF is meant to
be a transport format for a family of Desktop Publishing Software,
dealing mostly with the design of a text.

   Although the possible different commands and styles in  LaTeX
ifnottex  are much more flexible and standardized than in RTF, only a
small subset of commands has been implemented to date.  *Note
Unimplemented Features::.

   Some of the capabilities of  LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex  are restricted in
scope or buggy. *Note Known Bugs::.

   RTF is a moving target, because Microsoft does not stop inventing
new extensions and features for it. So you cannot view newer RTF files
with older word processors.

   LaTeX2RTF  ifnottex  eventually will generate RTF output that is
unreadable with your Program.  The syntax and semantics of RTF are
somewhat artistic, i.e., you can generate a syntactically correct RTF
file that cannot be displayed by some/most word processors.

   For more details on RTF look at the RTF-Tools by Paul DuBois, and
the corresponding newsgroups, etc. http://www.primate.wisc.edu/
